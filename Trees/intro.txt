Tree is an interesting data structure. It has wide constiety of applications in all sorts of fields. For example:

DOM is a tree data structure
Directory and files in our OS can be represented as trees
A family hierarchy can be represented as a tree.
There are bunch of constiations of tree (such as heaps, BST etc.) which can be used in solving problems related to scheduling, image processing, databases etc.

Trees in a nutshell
A tree is a non-linear data structure that organizes data hierarchically in nodes and cannot 
contain cycles. A tree has a specific terminology that may consty slightly, but commonly, the 
following notions are adopted:
• Root is the topmost node.
• Edge is the link or connection between two nodes.
• Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node.
• Child is a node that has a parent node.
• Leaf is a node that does not have a child node.
• Height is the length of the longest path to a Leaf
• Depth is the length of the path to its root.


Two Techniques for tree traversal : 
    i) Breadth-First Techniques
    ii) Depth-first Techniques

Breadth-First Techniques (BFS) :
    i) In - order traversal --> Left -> Root --> Right
    ii) Pre - order traversal   --> Root --> Left --> Right
    iii) Post - order traversal --> Left --> Right --> Root
